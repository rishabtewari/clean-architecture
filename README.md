# Clean Architecture Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Clean Architecture** principles. It is designed to separate concerns between business logic, domain models, and infrastructure, ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and testable application.

## Project Structure

This application follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern by dividing the code into layers. The goal is to decouple business logic from technical details and frameworks. This structure allows for flexibility, easy testing, and maintainability.

**Layers:**
- **Entities (Domain):** Business logic and core rules.
- **Use Cases (Interactors):** Application-specific logic.
- **Interface Adapters (Controller/Presenter):** Manages input/output operations.
- **Infrastructure (Repository/Services):** Handles external concerns like database, APIs, or frameworks.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** Decouples components by inverting dependency management.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Provides flexibility in swapping components, making testing easier.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Business rules are separated from data access and presentation layers.
- **Testability:** Since business logic is isolated, it becomes easier to test.

---

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies and tools:

- **TypeScript**
- **Node.js / Express (Optional)**
- **InversifyJS (Dependency Injection)**
- **Jest (Testing)**
- **Database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL)**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/clean-architecture-project.git
    cd clean-architecture-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables in `.env` (if necessary):

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can interact with the API (if itâ€™s a web service), or test the core business logic if it's a library. Endpoints and actions can be defined depending on the application.

**Sample Workflow**:

1. Call a use case (e.g., `DeactivateUser`).
2. The interactor fetches the user from the repository.
3. The user entity is modified (e.g., deactivated).
4. Changes are persisted, and notifications are sent out.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is designed to separate different layers of the application for better scalability.
